    "* In the physical sciences, experiments can be designed to explore theories about the physical world expressed in the language of mathematics.  Other than philosophical debates about existence (are we just a simulation on someone else's computer?), there are no questions regarding causation.\n",

    "        - Sir Arthur Eddington's photographs of solar eclipses to examine the bending of light by massive objects.\n",

    "## A Continued Discussion of Empirical Causality\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prior to the 1930s, there were few government-sponsored measures of economic activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As the US and Europe slid into the Great Depression, policy makers lacked basic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the US, the National Accounts were born in 1934 and greatly expanded during and after WWII.\n",
    "\n",
    "* At the same time, Alfred Cowles established the Cowles Commission for Research in Economics.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cowles approach was a probabilistic framework to estimate systems of simultaneous equations to model an economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ultimately would develop very large scale econometric models to examine a host of different economic variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Main insight was a demonstrated bias of linear regression estimates derived from such models.\n",
    "    * Approach was found to be inadequate for policy evaluation (“Goodhart’s law” and “Lucas critique”).\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Goodhart's Law\n",
    "\n",
    "* Goodhart “asserts that any economic relation tends to break down when used for policy purposes.”  (Wickens [2008].)\n",
    "    * Proposed relationships, economic or otherwise, are not structural in nature.\n",
    "    * Instead they sre derived from fundamental behavioral relationships (structural).\n",
    "    \n",
    "### The Lucas Critique\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lucas (1976) notes that individual decision rules affected by policy are driven by “deep structural parameters.” \n",
    "    * Decision rules and, therefore, decisions are contingent on the state of the system as it is.\n",
    "    * Change the system through policy, change the decision rule.\n",
    "    * Such changes may not be captured in non-structural models.\n",

    "### Experimental Design: Natural Experiments (Freakonomics)\n",
    "\n",
    "> A natural experiment is an empirical study in which individuals (or clusters of individuals) exposed to the experimental and control conditions are determined by nature or by other factors outside the control of the investigators, yet the process governing the exposures arguably resembles random assignment.\n",
