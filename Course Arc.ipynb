    "    * Multivariate regression remains a staple of analytics because of ease of interpretation and tractibility.\n",
    "* The R$^2$ metric is often misused, in particular when it is cited in isolation as a measure of the predictive power of an algorithmic specification.\n",
    "    * The metric is relative and to be used when comparing nested specifications.\n",
    "    * CAPM is nested in FF3F, which is nested in FF5F.  One can compare the R$^2$ across the models.\n",
    "    * Certain use cases are very difficult, such as interest rate prediction.  One can find a relationship between short- and long-term interest rates that still has little predictive power.\n",

    "* Some relevant math on calculating returns:\n",
    "\n",
    "$r_{t+1}= \\displaystyle {\\frac{p_{t+1}+d_t-p_t}{p_t}=\\frac{p_{t+1}-p_t}{p_t}+\\frac{d_t}{p_t}=\\text{gain + yield}}$\n",

    "\n",
    "$r_{t+1} \\approx \\displaystyle {\\ln(p_{t+1})-\\ln({p_t})}$, which justifies the use of log returns for daily stock prices.\n",

    "* The left side is expected returns, given today's knowledge, $p_t$, and the right side is the expectation of tomorrow's news given today's knowledge, $p_t$.  Tomorrow's news is not forecastable (otherwise it would be included in today's price).  Hence, expected returns cannot be forecasted.  \n",

    "## Class 8\n",
    "### More on Omitted Variable Bias: Breaking Every Algorithm\n",
    "### An Introduction to Machine Learning, Classification and Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "* Omitted variable bias: What cannot be measured, cannot be included in the fitting of any algorithm.  \n",
    "    * As a result, we may have to rely on \"proxies\".\n",
    "    * It can be difficult to assess the actual impact.  In the Monte Carlo example, the positive correlation passed 1:1 on the measured impact.  That is, it biased upward our measurement.\n",
    "    * In the CBRE cap rate model, it induced a theoretically-incorrect impact on the relationship between long-term US Treasurys and cap rates.\n",
    "    * In the Griliches example, it biased upward the ROI to education.\n",
    "\n",
    "* On an introduction to machine learning, the use case changed.  \n",
    "    * Machine learning is typically focused on prediction (the Zestimate for example) rather than evaluating the impact of an intervention (such as the ROI to education).\n",
    "     Key insight was not to use all of the data available, but rather randomly \"split\" the data into two types: training data and test data.  The algorithm is fitted on the training data, but its performance is evaluated on the test data.  We will explore this idea in-depth in our next class."
