    "* Explore conjectures about the world in a logically-coherent maanner.  \n",
    "    * Without data, this is now called **thought leadership**.\n",
    "    * Time series as storytelling and for forecasting.\n",
    "    * Examples of spurious correlation and considerations about causation.\n",
    "* Introduce you to R and R Studio to rapidly expand your tool kit.\n",
    "* Provide historical background in probability and statistics.\n",
    "* R is a low-level programming language developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman (hence R).\n",
    "* I will be using Jupyter notebooks (as a substitute for PowerPoint) for your benefit.\n",
    "    * Occasional use of Python graphics in class.\n",
    "    * Visualizations and Monte Carlo methods rather than mathematical proofs.\n",
    "    * **You are not responsible for Python.**\n",
    "    * You will use R and R Studio with sample R code to be implemented in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why R and R Studio?\n",
    "* Stable code base and platform\n",
    "* Open source and free\n",
    "* Learning curve is not steep, allowing for immediate immersion in data acquisition and analysis\n",
    "* Compatible with other statistical learning environments, and this class is focused on ideas \n",
    "* Open source and free\n",
    "* These notes will live until we turn out the lights.\n",
    "* Provide you with many examples from a variety of sources, including real estate and finance.\n",
    "* Typical class: Lecture and discussion with examples, as well as in-class labs.\n",
